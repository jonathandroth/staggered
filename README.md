# staggered

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The staggered R package computes the efficient estimator for settings
with randomized treatment timing, based on the theoretical results in
[Roth and Sant’Anna (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01291.pdf). If
units are randomly (or quasi-randomly) assigned to begin treatment at
different dates, the efficient estimator can potentially offer
substantial gains over methods that only impose parallel trends. The
package also allows for calculating the generalized
difference-in-differences estimators of [Callaway and Sant’Anna
(2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407620303948?dgcid=author)
and [Sun and Abraham
(2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030440762030378X)
and the simple-difference-in-means as special cases. We also provide a
Stata [implementation](#stata-implementation) via the RCall package.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonathandroth/staggered")
```

## Example

We now illustrate how to use the package by re-creating some of the
results in the application section of [Roth and Sant’Anna
(2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01291.pdf). Our data contains a
balanced panel of police officers in Chicago who were randomly given a
procedural justice training on different dates.

### Loading the package and the data

We first load the staggered package as well as some auxiliary packages
for modifying and plotting the results.

``` r
library(staggered) #load the staggered package
library(dplyr) #load dplyr for data manipulation
#> Warning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.0.5
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(ggplot2) #load ggplot2 for plotting the results
#> Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.0.5
library(purrr)

df <- staggered::pj_officer_level_balanced #load the officer data
```

### Simple aggregate parameters

We now can call the function calculate\_adjusted\_estimator\_and\_se to
calculate the efficient estimator. With staggered treatment timing,
there are several ways to aggregate treatment effects across cohorts and
time periods. The following block of code calculates the simple,
calendar-weighted, and cohort-weighted average treatment effects (see
Section 3.2 of [Roth and Sant’Anna
(2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01291.pdf) for more about different
aggregation schemes).

``` r
#Calculate efficient estimator for the simple weighted average
staggered(df = df, 
          i = "uid",
          t = "period",
          g = "first_trained",
          y = "complaints", 
          estimand = "simple")
#>       estimate          se   se_neyman
#> 1 -0.001126981 0.002115194 0.002119248
```

``` r
#Calculate efficient estimator for the cohort weighted average
staggered(df = df, 
          i = "uid",
          t = "period",
          g = "first_trained",
          y = "complaints", 
          estimand = "cohort") 
#>       estimate          se   se_neyman
#> 1 -0.001084689 0.002261011 0.002264876
```

``` r
#Calculate efficient estimator for the calendar weighted average
staggered(df = df, 
          i = "uid",
          t = "period",
          g = "first_trained",
          y = "complaints", 
          estimand = "calendar")
#>      estimate         se   se_neyman
#> 1 -0.00187198 0.00255863 0.002561472
```

### Event-study Parameters

We can also calculate an \`\`event-study’’ that computes the
average-treatment effect at each lag since treatment.

``` r
#Calculate event-study coefficients for the first 24 months (month 0 is instantaneous effect)
eventPlotResults <- staggered(df = df,         
                              i = "uid",
                              t = "period",
                              g = "first_trained",
                              y = "complaints", 
                              estimand = "eventstudy", 
                              eventTime = 0:23)
  
eventPlotResults %>% head()
#>        estimate          se   se_neyman eventTime
#> 1  3.083575e-04 0.002645327 0.002650957         0
#> 2  2.591678e-03 0.002614563 0.002621513         1
#> 3 -4.872562e-05 0.002622640 0.002623634         2
#> 4  2.043434e-03 0.002715695 0.002720467         3
#> 5  2.977076e-03 0.002653917 0.002659630         4
#> 6  7.979656e-04 0.002721784 0.002727140         5
```

``` r
#Create event-study plot from the results of the event-study
eventPlotResults %>% 
    mutate(ymin_ptwise = estimate + 1.96*se,
           ymax_ptwise = estimate - 1.96*se)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=eventTime, y =estimate)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = ymin_ptwise, ymax = ymax_ptwise))+ 
  geom_hline(yintercept =0) +
  xlab("Event Time") + ylab("Estimate") +
  ggtitle("Effect of Procedural Justice Training on Officer Complaints")
```

### Other Estimators

Our package also allows for the calculation of several other estimators
proposed in the literature. For convenience we provide special functions
for implementing the estimators proposed by Callaway & Sant’Anna and Sun
& Abraham. The syntax is nearly identical to that for the efficient
estimator:

``` r
#Calculate Callaway and Sant'Anna estimator for the simple weighted average
staggered_cs(df = df, 
             i = "uid",
             t = "period",
             g = "first_trained",
             y = "complaints", 
             estimand = "simple")
#>       estimate          se   se_neyman
#> 1 -0.005176818 0.003928735 0.003930919
```

``` r
#Calculate Sun and Abraham estimator for the simple weighted average
staggered_sa(df = df, 
             i = "uid",
             t = "period",
             g = "first_trained",
             y = "complaints", 
             estimand = "simple")
#>     estimate         se  se_neyman
#> 1 0.01153851 0.01730161 0.01730234
```

The Callaway and Sant’Anna estimator corresponds with calling the
staggered function with beta=1 (and the default use\_DiD\_A0=1), and the
Sun and Abraham estimator corresponds with calling staggered with beta=1
and use\_last\_treated\_only=T. If one is interested in the simple
difference-in-means, one can call the staggered function with option
beta=0.

Note that the standard errors returned in the se column are based on the
design-based approach in Roth & Sant’Anna, and thus will differ somewhat
from those returned by the did package. The standard errors in
se\_neyman should be very similar to those returned by the did package,
although not identical in finite samples.

## Stata implementation

We also provide a Stata implementation (staggered\_stata) via the RCall
package, which calls the staggered R package from within Stata.

### Installation

To install the staggered\_stata package, the user first needs to install
the github and RCall packages. This can be done with the following
commands

    > net install github, from("https://haghish.github.io/github/")
    > github install haghish/rcall, version("2.5.0")

**Important note:** the staggered\_stata package was built under Rcall
version 2.5.0, and the recent release of RCall version 3.0 has created
some compatibility issues. We will try our best to fix these issues, but
in the meantime it is best to install version 2.5.0, as in the command
above.

Note that the user must have R installed before installing the RCall
package. The latest version of R can be downloaded
[here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). The staggered\_stata package can
then be installed with

    > github install jonathandroth/staggered_stata

The three packages can also be installed by downloading the ado files
from the package webpages ([github](https://github.com/haghish/github),
[RCall](https://github.com/haghish/rcall),
[staggered\_stata](https://github.com/jonathandroth/staggered_stata))
directly and pasting them into the user’s ado/personal directory.

### Usage

The syntax for staggered\_stata is very similar to that for the
staggered R package. Below are a few illustrative examples, using the
same data as above.

    >use "https://github.com/jonathandroth/staggered_stata/raw/master/pj_officer_level_balanced.dta"
    >staggered, y("complaints") g("first_trained") t("period") i("uid") estimand("simple")
    >staggered_cs, y("complaints") g("first_trained") t("period") i("uid") estimand("eventstudy") eventTimeStart(-2) eventTimeEnd(2)
    >staggered_sa, y("complaints") g("first_trained") t("period") i("uid") estimand("cohort")

![Stata examples.](man/figures/Stata_screenshot.png)

The staggered, staggered\_cs, and staggered\_as commands all return a
vector of coefficients and covariance matrix in ereturn list, and thus
can be used with any post-estimation command in Stata (e.g. coefplot).
