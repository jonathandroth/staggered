\usage{
staggered_cs(
  df,
  i = "i",
  t = "t",
  g = "g",
  y = "y",
  estimand = NULL,
  A_theta_list = NULL,
  A_0_list = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing panel data with the variables y (an outcome), i (an individual identifier), t (the period in which the outcome is observe), g (the period in which i is first treated, with Inf denoting never treated)}

\item{i}{The name of column containing the individual (cross-sectional unit) identifier. Default is "i".}

\item{t}{The name of the column containing the time periods. Default is "t".}

\item{g}{The name of the column containing the first period when a particular observation is treated, with Inf denoting never treated. Default is "g".}

\item{y}{The name of the column containing the outcome variable. Default is "y".}

\item{estimand}{The estimand to be calculated: "simple" averages all treated (t,g) combinations with weights proportional to N_g; "cohort" averages the ATEs for each cohort g, and then takes an N_g-weighted average across g; "calendar" averages ATEs for each time period, weighted by N_g for treated units, and then averages across time. "eventstudy" returns the average effect at the ''event-time'' given in the parameter EventTime.  The parameter can be left blank if a custom parameter is provided in A_theta_list. The argument is not case-sensitive.}

\item{A_theta_list}{This parameter allows for specifying a custom estimand, and should be left as NULL if estimand is specified. It is a list of matrices A_theta_g so that the parameter of interest is sum_g A_theta_g Ybar_g, where Ybar_g = 1/N sum_i Y_i(g)}

\item{A_0_list}{This parameter allow for specifying the matrices used to construct the Xhat vector of pre-treatment differences. If left NULL, the default is to use the scalar set of controls used in Callaway and Sant'Anna. If use_DiD_A0 = FALSE, then it uses the full vector possible comparisons of (g,g') in periods t<g,g'.}

\item{eventTime}{If using estimand = "eventstudy", specify what eventTime you want the event-study parameter for. The default is 0, the period in which treatment occurs. If a vector is provided, estimates are returned for all the event-times in the vector.}

\item{return_full_vcv}{If this is true and estimand = "eventstudy", then the function returns a list containing the full variance-covariance matrix for the event-plot estimates in addition to the usual dataframe with the estimates}

\item{return_matrix_list}{If true, the function returns a list of the A_0_list and A_theta_list matrices along with betastar. This is used for internal recursive calls to calculate the variance-covariance matrix, and will generally not be needed by the end-user. Default is False.}

\item{compute_fisher}{If true, computes a Fisher Randomization Test using the studentized estimator.}

\item{num_fisher_permutations}{The number of permutations to use in the Fisher Randomization Test (if compute_fisher = TRUE). Default is 500.}

\item{skip_data_check}{If true, skips checks that the data is balanced and contains the colums i,t,g,y. Used in internal recursive calls to increase speed, but not recommended for end-user.}
}
\value{
resultsDF A data.frame containing: estimate (the point estimate), se (the standard error), and se_neyman (the Neyman standard error). If a vector-valued eventTime is provided, the data.frame contains multiple rows for each eventTime and an eventTime column. If return_full_vcv = TRUE and estimand = "eventstudy", the function returns a list containing resultsDF and the full variance covariance for the event-study estimates (vcv) as well as the Neyman version of the covariance matrix (vcv_neyman). (If return_matrix_list = TRUE, it likewise returns a list containing lists of matrices used in the vcv calculation.)

This functions calculates the Callaway & Sant'Anna (2020) estimator for staggered rollout designs using not-yet-treated units (including never-treated, if available) as controls.
